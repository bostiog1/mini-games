# React + Vite

A Blog project where I can post, delete, update, and create. 

The main idea of the project was to practice various concepts such as: 

-state management with : 
    -Context API
    -Redux toolkit
-CRUD
-Dark Mode
-how to create a JSON Server
-error handler
-git

# Command for running the sever: json-server --watch src/data/db.json
